# Django-Ecommerce
Welcome to my first Django based project: Pythonista's Store üêç!
I'm developing this project following Codigo Facilito's course on Web Applications with Django, here I will be leaving registry of my advances on it.

This is meant to be a project exploring and including most of Django's interesting features such as forms, user authentication, template rendering, shopping-cart management, billing and more!

Since it is my first project I aim to use Django features purely regarding front-end (apart from Bootstrap). However, it is planned in the future to add some front-end framework to make it more appealing to users and, also to develop a well rounded full stack project. Vue.js, React, Angular? I don't know just yet!
Hope you enjoy visiting this project as much I as I do working on it. =)
