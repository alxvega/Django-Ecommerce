# Django-Ecommerce
Welcome to my first Django based project!
I'm doing this project following Codigo Facilito's course on Web Applications with Django, here I will be leaving registry of my advances on it.
Since it is my first project I aim to use Django features purely regarding front-end (apart from Bootstrap), such as template rendering and jinja htmls. 
It's planned in the future to add some front-end framework to make it more appealing to users and learn to develop a well rounded full stack project. Vue.js, React, Angular? I don't know just yet.
Hope you enjoy visiting this project as much I as I do working on it. :)
